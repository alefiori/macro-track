# MacroTrack

[![CI](https://github.com/alefiori/macro-track/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/alefiori/macro-track/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/711ad0e3-f068-4066-8538-38bab13b2bab/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/macros-track/deploys)

A responsive, installable daily macros tracker built with **React + Vite +
TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Supabase** (Postgres + Auth). Set
per-weekday macro targets, log foods against them, and watch your daily carbs /
protein / fats fill up. Food data comes from your own custom foods, foods shared
by the community, and three free databases:
[Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org),
[USDA FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov), and
[Edamam](https://developer.edamam.com/food-database-api).

The app is a **PWA** (installable, works offline via a precached shell), is fully
**localized into 7 languages**, and lets you **try it instantly as a guest**
before creating an account.

The UI is a faithful port of the Google Stitch design export in
[`design/stitch_macrotrack_health_dashboard/`](design/stitch_macrotrack_health_dashboard/) —
colors, typography, spacing, radii, and components are taken from `DESIGN.md`
and the per-screen `code.html` files.

## Features

- **Email/password auth** (sign up, sign in, sign out, forgot password) with a
  persisted session; all app routes are gated behind an auth guard.
- **Guest mode** — "continue as guest" starts an anonymous session so you can
  try the app with zero signup. A persistent banner offers to **upgrade to a
  permanent account** later, keeping the same `user_id` so all logged data
  carries over.
- **My Targets** — per-weekday carbs/protein/fats goals with live calorie totals
  and "copy one day to all days".
- **Daily Tracker** — date selector, three macro progress rings (consumed vs.
  target + remaining), foods grouped by meal with inline edit/delete, and a
  calorie summary.
- **Copy day & copy meal** — duplicate a whole day's logs onto another date, or
  copy a single meal into any meal slot on any day (appends, preserving
  servings).
- **Add Food** — debounced search merging your own foods, community foods, and
  live Open Food Facts / USDA / Edamam results (each tagged with its source);
  pick a meal, adjust servings, and log. Includes a **barcode scanner**
  (camera-based, via ZXing) for looking foods up by their UPC/EAN.
- **Create Custom Food** — name, serving, per-serving macros with live calorie
  calc, plus "save & add to today".
- **My Foods** — manage your custom and imported foods, and **share them to the
  community** (or unshare) so other users can find and reuse them.
- **Share meals & days** — export a meal or a whole day as compact,
  emoji-annotated plain text via the native share sheet (WhatsApp, iMessage, …),
  falling back to the clipboard where no share sheet exists.
- **Internationalization** — the UI is available in English, Italian, French,
  Spanish, German, Portuguese, and Dutch. A single preference on the Profile
  page drives both the interface language **and** the language of Open Food Facts
  results.
- **Installable PWA** — add to home screen / install as an app; the app shell is
  precached so it launches offline.

## Getting started

### 1. Create a Supabase project

1. Sign in at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project.
2. Once it's provisioned, open **Settings → API** and note the
   **Project URL** and the **anon/public** API key.

### 2. Run the database migrations

The schema (tables + row-level security, profiles, community foods, and the
extra food sources) lives in the ordered SQL files under
[`supabase/migrations/`](supabase/migrations/).

**Option A — Supabase CLI (recommended, applies every migration):**

```bash
npm install -g supabase
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
supabase db push
```

**Option B — Supabase SQL Editor:** open the SQL Editor in the dashboard and run
each migration file **in order** (`0001_init.sql` → `0006_community_food_safety.sql`).

Together the migrations create `macro_targets`, `foods`, `food_logs`, and
`profiles`; enable RLS with owner-only policies (global foods with a null
`user_id` are readable by everyone); add the `usda` and `edamam` food sources;
add per-user profile settings (preferred language); and add **community foods**
(`foods.is_public`) — including the guards that keep a shared food safe to
unshare and prevent deleting one that other people have logged.

### 3. Enable guest sign-in (optional but recommended)

The "continue as guest" flow uses Supabase **anonymous sign-ins**. Enable them
under **Authentication → Providers → Anonymous Sign-Ins** in the dashboard.
Without this, only email/password auth works.

### 4. Deploy the `food-search` Edge Function

All external food lookups (text search + barcode) run **server-side** in a
Supabase [Edge Function](supabase/functions/food-search), not from the browser.
This is required: [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org)' search API
sends no CORS headers, so browsers can't call it directly, and the USDA/Edamam
API keys must not ship in the client bundle. The function fans out to every
source in parallel, normalizes results to a shared shape, and de-duplicates them.

```bash
supabase functions deploy food-search --project-ref <your-project-ref>

# Optional: set the USDA key as a function secret (defaults to DEMO_KEY)
supabase secrets set USDA_API_KEY=your-fdc-api-key --project-ref <your-project-ref>

# Optional: enable the Edamam source (skipped entirely when unset)
supabase secrets set EDAMAM_APP_ID=your-app-id EDAMAM_APP_KEY=your-app-key --project-ref <your-project-ref>

# Optional: authenticate Open Food Facts to skip its anonymous rate limit
supabase secrets set OFF_USERNAME=your-off-user OFF_PASSWORD=your-off-password --project-ref <your-project-ref>
```

A free USDA key comes from the
[FoodData Central signup](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-key-signup.html); without
it the function uses the shared `DEMO_KEY`, which works but is heavily
rate-limited (and may return 429s under load). Edamam credentials come from the
[Edamam Food Database API](https://developer.edamam.com/food-database-api)
(free tier available); without them the Edamam source is silently skipped and
the other sources still work.

Open Food Facts needs no API key — read access is fully open. It does, however,
throttle **anonymous** traffic during peak load (returning 503s), so OFF results
are best-effort by default. To make them reliable, set `OFF_USERNAME` /
`OFF_PASSWORD` to a free [Open Food Facts account](https://world.openfoodfacts.org):
the function then sends those over HTTP Basic Auth (OFF's only credential — there
are no keys) and the requests skip the anonymous limit. When unset, OFF calls
stay anonymous.

> **Until the function is deployed, food search and barcode lookup return
> nothing** — the client no longer calls the food APIs directly.

### 5. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then fill in `.env` with your project's values:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-public-key
```

No food-API keys live here — they're function secrets (see step 4), kept out of
the client bundle. `.env` is gitignored — never commit secrets. The anon key is
safe to ship in a client bundle; RLS is what protects your data.

> **Email confirmation:** by default Supabase requires email confirmation on
> sign-up. For local testing you can disable it under
> **Authentication → Providers → Email** so new accounts can sign in
> immediately.

### 6. Install and run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed local URL (default <http://localhost:5173>).

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run build      # type-check + production build
npm run preview    # preview the production build
npm run typecheck  # type-check only (no emit)
```

## How external food data is modeled

Open Food Facts, USDA FoodData Central, and Edamam all report nutrients
**per 100 g**, so every imported food is stored on a fixed **100 g basis**
(`serving_amount=100`, `serving_unit='g'`) using the per-100g values directly —
logging then works in multiples of 100 g (1.5 servings = 150 g). When a search
result is logged, the app **upserts** it into `foods` with the appropriate
`source` (`'openfoodfacts'`, `'usda'`, or `'edamam'`), `off_id=<the source's id>`
(barcode/code for OFF, `fdcId` for USDA, `foodId` for Edamam), and
`is_custom=false` — de-duplicating on
`(source, off_id)` — before inserting the `food_logs` row. Logs always reference
a stable local food. Results missing carbohydrate/protein/fat data are skipped.

Search ([`useFoodSearch`](src/hooks/useFoodSearch.ts)) queries the user's own
foods (locally, via Supabase) alongside a single call to the
[`food-search` Edge Function](supabase/functions/food-search/index.ts) through a
thin client ([`src/lib/foodApi.ts`](src/lib/foodApi.ts)). The function holds a
small registry of source adapters — currently Open Food Facts, USDA, and
Edamam — runs them in parallel, normalizes each to the shared
`ExternalFood` shape, and merges + de-duplicates across sources; a failing source
degrades gracefully to no results from that source. **Adding a new source**
(e.g. FatSecret, Nutritionix) is a server-side-only change: add an adapter to the
function's `SOURCES` array — no client or env changes needed. All math (4/4/9 kcal
per gram, per-serving scaling, per-100g conversion, remaining-vs-target, ring
offsets) lives in [`src/lib/macros.ts`](src/lib/macros.ts).

## Community foods

Any custom food can be **shared to the community** by toggling `foods.is_public`
from **My Foods**; shared foods then show up in every user's search. Sharing
preserves attribution (the owner's `user_id` is kept), so publishers keep
edit/delete rights. Two safety guards back this (see
[`0006_community_food_safety.sql`](supabase/migrations/0006_community_food_safety.sql)):

- **Unsharing is always safe** — a user can still read any food they've logged,
  even after the owner unshares it, so a logged entry never breaks.
- **A shared food that others have logged can't be deleted** — deletion would
  cascade to other people's logs, so the owner must unshare it instead.

## Internationalization

The UI ships in 7 languages (English, Italian, French, Spanish, German,
Portuguese, Dutch). The i18n core ([`src/lib/i18n/`](src/lib/i18n/)) is
dependency-free: catalogs are plain nested objects and `translate()` resolves
dot-paths with `{name}` interpolation, falling back to English then the raw key
so a missing translation never throws. The English catalog
([`locales/en.ts`](src/lib/i18n/locales/en.ts)) is canonical — TypeScript
enforces that every other locale matches its shape. The selected locale is the
same value stored in `profiles.off_language`, so **one preference drives both the
UI language and the Open Food Facts result language**.
